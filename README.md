## AnimatedSleeves setup

### there are three methods for having animated sleeves, either each frame is a seperate image or the sleeve image is an apng file or one big spritesheet

#### each `frame` referred to here is and must be 524px x 40px (width x height) in size !!!

#### the sleeve images are located at where rhythm doctor's save files are to e.g. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Rhythm Doctor\User\`

### if you are doing the apng, do note that:

- this is experimental so idk if it works please alert me if not
- apngs are a bit special and idk where you make them so

the apng should be placed where the sleeve images are and should be suffixed with `_animated`, e.g. `scribbleP1_0_animated.png`
<br>

### if you are doing the spritesheet, do note that:

- there cannot be empty spots in the spritesheet
- the program will read from left to right, top to bottom, so make sure to export correctly (e.g. in aseprite horizontal strip or by rows i think)
- the game will refuse to handle an image that's too big in width or height so keep that in mind

the spritesheet should be placed where the sleeve images are and should be suffixed with `_animated`, e.g. `scribbleP1_0_animated.png`
<br>

### if you are doing it with individual images

each image should have the suffix of `_frameX` where X is a number starting from 1 e.g. like:

`scribbleP1_0_frame1.png`, `scribbleP1_0_frame2.png`, `scribbleP1_0_frame3.png`, ...
<br>

### *please do ask for more details if there's some parts you don't understand*

## EditorPatches

- DisableSliderLimits -> numerical slider limits are disabled (albeit you must use the input field)
- DuplicateDecorationButton -> adds a button to duplicate a deco, above the delete button for the deco
- EditorBorderTintOpacity -> (will only work with DisableSliderLimits enabled) adds a slider for border/tint opacity, meant for under/overtinting (hence why slider limits need to be disabled)
- InsertDeleteBars -> Alt + left click inserts a bar, alt + right click deletes the bar clicked (hard to explain shortly)
